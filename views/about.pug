        p I worked at the 
          span.bold Psychology Lab 
          | of IIT Roorkee under the supervision of Prof. Manish Kumar Asthana. I was responsible for developing a number of interactive virtual environments on Unity and Vizard 7. These were used to collect behavioural data of users by testing them on particular tasks. I also analysed participant's behavioural data thus collected to gain insights into their behaviour.

          span.bold Razorpay 
          | as a Full-Stack Designer during the summers of 2019 where I designed and developed an
